drupal-open-curricullum
=======================

This project is for collaborating on open college level curriculum for teaching CMS courses using Drupal as the platform for learning and student final projects. This curriculum is intended for online or face-to-face courses or blended learning. I was inspired by "https://gitorious.org/drupal-open-curriculum" and was first informed by Steve Purkiss (https://groups.drupal.org/user/8816). If you are teaching a CMS course and using Drupal as the main CMS for final projects, please join me. At the moment, I am going to focus on Drupal 7
